**First create**
Please read the `docs/Proj_Planning.md` document, create the corresponding directories, and prepare the necessary files (output files are not needed). The current environment is a conda virtual environment (all libraries have been installed manually), and the directory has already been set up as a Git repository. I will update the `docs/Proj_Planning.md` document to add/change features, so please be prepared accordingly.

**Updata**
`docs/Proj_Planning.md` has been updated. 
Please: 1) Compare with the previous version to identify changes and document them in `docs/CHANGELOG.md` 2) Analyze the scope of impact 3) Provide a detailed implementation plan (architecture, pseudocode, file list, etc.) and update it in `docs/Architecture.md` 4) Implement your implementation plan.
